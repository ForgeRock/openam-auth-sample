*An OpenAM Sample Custom Authentication Module*

For instructions on using this sample authentication
module with OpenAM see the chapter,
*[Customizing Authentication Modules](http://openam.forgerock.org/openam-documentation/openam-doc-source/doc/dev-guide/index/chap-auth-spi.html)*,
in the OpenAM *Developer's Guide*.

Before building the sample authentication module, update
the OpenAM version in the POM to match the version of OpenAM
that you are using. The line to update is:

    <openam.version>12.0.0-SNAPSHOT</openam.version>
